# Beautiful-Interface

## 如果你喜欢，请给我一个 star

## introduction ##

    1. There are several good-looking interfaces. These interfaces was coded using python.

    2. These interfaces are designed by myself independently, So all files are open-source.

    3. Each interface file is "independent", so you can pull out the interface code separately and put it into the project you want

    4. If you have any questions, i'm willing to communicate with you.

    5. If you like this project, please give me one star. thank you very much
